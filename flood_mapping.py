Sentinel-1 Flood Inundation Mapping -- Township Dashboard, Permanent Web Map
============================================================================
WHY THIS APPROACH
  geemap.addLayer() writes GEE tile-server URLs into the HTML.  Those URLs
  expire after ~2 days, causing layers to go blank.  This script avoids that
  by downloading every layer as a GeoTIFF, converting it to a palette PNG and
  publishing that PNG as page-local data -- either a base64 data URI inside the
  HTML or a file in ASSET_DIR next to it.  Either way nothing points at a
  Google server, so the map never expires.

METHOD
  Change-detection: VV backscatter difference (post - pre, dB).
  Flooded open water causes specular reflection away from the sensor,
  producing a sharp drop in VV backscatter.

  The result is then summarised per MIMU township and per MIMU village point,
  so the product is not just a picture but an impact table.

DATA      Copernicus Sentinel-1 GRD IW (via Google Earth Engine)
          MIMU township boundaries (adm3, 250k, v9.4) and village points
          (pplp2, 250k, PCode v9.7) -- geonode.themimu.info GeoServer WFS
AOI       Loaded from AOI_GEOJSON = merged_6_townships.geojson -- six whole
          MIMU townships in Ayeyarwady Region, 6,667 km2: Hinthada and
          Lemyethna (Hinthada District), plus Kyaunggon, Kyonpyaw, Thabaung
          and Yegyi (Pathein District).  Because the AOI IS the townships,
          nothing is clipped and every "% flooded" is of the whole township.
Pre-flood  2026-07-24
Post-flood 2026-08-29
Output     index.html + ASSET_DIR/*.png  -- self-hosted, never-expiring

DATA AVAILABILITY (checked against the GEE catalogue on 2026-08-30 ~10:50 UTC)
  Three Sentinel-1 tracks image this AOI, each on a 12-day repeat:

      ASCENDING  track  41 : 07-20, 08-01, 08-13, 08-25
      ASCENDING  track 143 : 07-27, 08-08, 08-20
      DESCENDING track 106 : 07-24, 08-05, 08-17, [08-29]   <- USED

  Both requested dates fall on DESCENDING track 106, 36 days apart -- exactly
  three repeat cycles -- so this is the same ground track imaged three cycles
  over: same viewing geometry, same incidence angle, the cleanest possible
  basis for differencing.  Each date is covered by 2 scenes at 100.0% of the
  AOI, measured rather than assumed, in BOTH collections.

  2026-08-29 crosses this AOI at 23:32 UTC (06:02 local on the 30th) and was
  fully ingested about 11 hours later, so no waiting was needed.  The guards
  are still in force: availability is judged on COVERAGE, not scene presence,
  and a pass younger than FRESH_PASS_HOURS that is short of MIN_AOI_COVERAGE
  stops the run rather than mapping a fraction of the area.

  CAVEAT ON THE BASELINE: 2026-07-24 is itself mid-monsoon, not a dry-season
  image.  What is mapped is water that appeared BETWEEN 24 July and 29 August,
  so ground already under water on 24 July is not counted.  This is the
  intended change-detection product but a lower bound on total standing water
  on 29 August.  Note that the 24 Jul -> 17 Aug product over the wider western
  AOI shares this baseline, so the two are directly comparable on these six
  townships: this run extends the same window by two more repeat cycles.

RESOLUTION
  Every layer -- flood mask, permanent water AND both SAR VV backdrops -- is
  produced and displayed at Sentinel-1's native 10 m GRD pixel spacing.  Every
  statistic, AOI-wide and per township, is reduced at 10 m too.  Nothing is
  downsampled anywhere in this script.

  That has a real cost, which is why the output is not a single file.  The AOI
  bbox is 1.667 deg x 2.253 deg, i.e. 18,559 x 25,077 px (465 Mpx) per layer at
  10 m.  Measured on the 2026-08-17 run:

      flood mask        @10 m ->    7.2 MB PNG  (binary, compresses ~65x)
      permanent water   @10 m ->    1.2 MB PNG  (embedded in the page)
      SAR VV backdrop   @10 m -> 260-268 MB PNG (speckle, near-incompressible)

  Base64 inflates by 1.33x, so embedding two native SAR backdrops would make a
  ~450 MB HTML file -- far over GitHub's hard 100 MB per-file push limit, and
  hopeless for a browser to parse.  So each layer is:

    * cut into chunks of at most MAX_CHUNK_PX pixels, with all-nodata chunks
      dropped -- worth a lot here, because the slanted AOI leaves large empty
      wedges in the bbox corners; and
    * embedded as base64 if the whole layer is under EMBED_MAX_MB, otherwise
      written to ASSET_DIR/ and referenced by relative path.

  Chunks of a layer live in one Leaflet layer group, so they toggle as a unit.
  The SAR layers start hidden, so their bytes are only fetched if the user
  actually turns them on.  Download tiles that miss the AOI polygon entirely
  are never requested, and each layer's GeoTIFF is encoded and deleted before
  the next one starts, so peak disk stays around 1 GB rather than 3 GB.

  Deploying therefore means publishing index.html *and* the ASSET_DIR folder.

    MIMU village points are settlement locations, not built-up outlines, so the
    honest question is not "is this village under water" but "how much new water
    is there around this point".  Two radii are sampled:

      f_at    fraction of the VILLAGE_AT_M disc that is newly flooded
      f_near  fraction of the VILLAGE_NEAR_M disc that is newly flooded

    and a village is called inundated only above VILLAGE_AT_FRAC -- a handful of
    speckle pixels next to a settlement is not a flooded village.

    flag  2 = new water at the settlement
          1 = new water within VILLAGE_NEAR_M
          0 = none detected
         -1 = not assessed (no usable data on one of the two dates)
